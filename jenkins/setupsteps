Downloading and running Jenkins in Docker


If you already have docker installed on the machine all you need to do is run this command and it will pull jenkins images from the jub and run it on port 86 as I am testing the environment on my local computer

docker run -d --name Jenkins -p 86:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11

to login into the container to get the password

docker exec -it containerID /bin/sh
